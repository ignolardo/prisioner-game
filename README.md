This code is a simulation of the prisoner game or cooperative game.

This code has been written in Go.

You can explore all the possibilities by changing strategies or even creating your own.

To run this simulation, you must first define the two strategies you want to use (there are already some built-in strategies in the strategies package)

You must also set the number of rounds you want to simulate.

Once you have all the settings defined, you can run the simulation by running:

`go run main.go` 

or 

`go run ./main.go`
